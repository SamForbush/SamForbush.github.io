The methods for generation include a charactere level LSTM model and the Hafez model. Along the way, we tested the ability of existing computational evaluators on generated poetry.

      "description": "This project, completed in 2019, simulates the distribution of rod cells in the human eye, taking into account the expected proportion of colored rods. It was developed in Ocaml as a part of the Computer Science 1 Honors program at Boston College. As shown, the cells are not completely randomly distributed, as there is approximately even space between any two neighboring cells. This was done to make a more realistic simulation, as the cells in the human eye are also approximately evenly spaced.",
